Raid Difficulty Checker is a World of Warcraft addon designed to enhance your raiding experience by providing clear and immediate information about your current raid instance and its difficulty.

Detects Raid Entry:
When you enter a raid instance, the addon detects it automatically.

Displays a Popup:
A popup window appears, showing the name of the raid, its difficulty (e.g. 10-Man Normal, 10-Man Heroic, Mythic).
The popup includes the specific difficulty variant, such as "10 Man Heroic" or "25 Man Heroic."

Localization Support:
The addon includes localization files for multiple languages but currently only has English.
It displays text in your clientâ€™s language for better accessibility.
If you want to have localization in your language then post a comment with the translations of the following and which language it is and I will add it to the next update

"You have entered" = "You have entered"
"10-Man" = "10-Man Normal"
"25-Man" = "25-Man Normal"
"10-Man Heroic" = "10-Man Heroic"
"25-Man Heroic" = "25-Man Heroic"
"40-Man" = "40-Man"
"Looking for Raid" = "Looking for Raid"
"Normal" = "Normal"
"Heroic" = "Heroic"
"Mythic" = "Mythic"
"Timewalking" = "Timewalking"
"Unknown" = "Unknown"



Error Handling:
If the instance size or difficulty cannot be determined, it defaults to "Unknown".

Purpose:
This addon helps players quickly understand their raid setup upon entry, reducing confusion and ensuring they are aware of the instance settings without needing to check manually.
